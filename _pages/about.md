I am an assistant professor of the Institute of Public Service at Seattle University. I got my PhD from the School of Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA) at Rutgers University-Newark. My researches topics of public administration and nonprofit management, including the sector stereotype in social service market, inter-sectoral collaboration and competition. My work has appeared in _Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory_ (JPART), _Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly_ (NVSQ), _Voluntas_, and _Philanthropy & Education_.

I teach graduate level courses including Foundations of Public Administration, Research Design, and Economic Analysis at the Institute of Public Service. My teaching philosophy holds strongly that the education of public and nonprofit administration shall serve as a nexus, which systematically bridges research, knowledge, and practice to solve social problems. In the past, I coordinated with Dr. Lindsey McDougle at Rutgers Newark on an innovative pedagogy known as "experiential philanthropy" for cultivating future philanthropists with strategic and critical thinking. The effectiveness of experiential philanthropy is evidenced by his article with colleagues published on _Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly_ as well as _Philanthropy & Education_.

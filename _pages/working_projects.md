### De-stereotyping Public Performance Evaluation. With Yixin Liu. <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3750366"><u>[Working paper: SSRN]</u></a>

> Experimental evidence suggests that citizens’ judgments of service quality often rely on prior beliefs about providers’ characteristics, such as sectoral or racial stereotypes. Such a biased judgment process prevents the public from understanding performance information accurately and choosing high-quality service providers. To address this, we studied the relation between performance information and the evaluation mode and propose that presenting information jointly (joint evaluation) rather than separately (separate evaluation) may help people avoid stereotyping and consider actual performance. We compared people’s perceived performance and preferences through the separate and joint evaluation modes (SE and JE) in three online experiments (N>3000), and obtained similar results in these studies: Subjects used sectoral or racial stereotypes to evaluate school performance in the SE condition, but the stereotyping decreased in the JE condition. Our findings provide an effective tool to de-stereotype performance evaluations, which also has implications for other public management research areas in reducing stereotyping behaviors.

### A Domain Model for Moral Legitimacy of Business-Like Practices.

> Legitimacy is one of critical assets for nonprofit organizations. However, as nonprofit organizations are growingly hybridized with business-like practices and social nonprofit missions, evidence on the cost and benefit of business-like practices for nonprofits’ legitimacy remains inconclusive. This study addresses this problem from a moral legitimacy perspective, proposing a domain model, which argues that the moral legitimacy of business-like practices for nonprofits varies based on whether the practice fits the principle in which people believe the organization should focus on, including Market Pricing principle and Communal Sharing principle. And such normative judgment can be determined by the service field and the sector tag of the organization. Findings of the online experiment support the model in general, but also shows important heterogeneity across service fields.  

### Discrimination against Immigrants in the U.S. Health Care Market. With Danbee Lee.

> Government can hardly achieve the fairness of public service provision if street-level bureaucrats use their discretions to treat clients systematically differently. As a part of service receivers, noncitizen immigrants are growingly important in political and economic issues in the United States. However, although previous evidence has well-documented street-level discrimination against certain groups of people, whether and how noncitizen immigrants are treated equally in the health care market remains an unanswered question. This study proposes an audit field experiment to identify the causal relation between noncitizen immigration status and potential discrimination on the frontline of U.S. nursing homes. Evidence from this field experiment will provide the first national wide evidence on discrimination against noncitizen immigrants in the U.S. and how public, nonprofit, and for-profit nursing homes treat noncitizen clients differently. Findings will also reveal the theoretical mechanism of street-level bureaucrats' discriminating behavior.
